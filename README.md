# Undergrad-Honours-Research-Project
Welcome! This repository contains my undergrad honours thesis work, and the work I've been completing afterwards to be able to write a paper. 

The skills and techniques demonstrated in this project are:

In summary, my project seeks to analyze wound healing responses in bone cells (osteoblasts). When osteoblasts encounter physical damage, ATP is released into the extracellular space. This ATP acts upon receptors on osteoblasts, which triggers calcium from the extracelluar space, and from internal cell stores, to flood inside the osteoblasts, leading to a wound healing response. This calcium response can be measured and visualized experimentally using calcium dyes, leading to the production of Calcium (concentration) vs. time(s) response curves. It turns out, there is a wide heterogeniety of calcium responses that are seen, and it depends on factors such as extracelluar [ATP] concentration, and the calcium receptors on the cell.
